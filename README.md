##Expandable Banner with cookie using jQuery

Using jQuery and div tags, the expandable banner auto expands for 4 seconds, then closes and places a cookie that expires in a day. 
The banner will not open again automatically till the cookie expires or is removed. Banner toggles open and close with a click.

You can put images, text, or anything else you want in the div tags, it's up to you.
