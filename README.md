##Expandable banner with cookie using jQuery

Using jQuery, the expandable banner auto expands the bottom div downwards for 4 seconds, then closes it and places a cookie that expires in a day. 
The banner will not open again automatically till the cookie expires or is removed. Banner toggles open and closed by clicking the top div.

[Working Example](http://deadfacestudios.com/exas/slider/slider.html#)

You can put images, text, or anything else you want in the div tags, it's up to you.

To get the cookie to work please download the latest version of carhartl's [jQuery cookie Plugin](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie). It's awesome.
