##Expandable banner with cookie using jQuery

I built this for a specific project at work, thought I'd share it on GitHub. Using jQuery and div tags, the expandable banner auto expands for 4 seconds, then closes and places a cookie that expires in a day. 
The banner will not open again automatically till the cookie expires or is removed. Banner toggles open and close with a click.

[Working Example](http://deadfacestudios.com/exas/slider/slider.html#)

You can put images, text, or anything else you want in the div tags, it's up to you.

To get the cookie to work please download the latest version of carhartl's [jQuery cookie Plugin](https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie). It's awesome.
